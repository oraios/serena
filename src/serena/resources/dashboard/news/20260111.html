    <h3>Symbol Documentation, Type Hierarchy and Better Overviews</h3>
    <p class="date">January 11, 2026</p>
    <p>
        Recent commits and a new plugin release contain major new features!
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Symbol Documentation:</strong> The `find_symbol` and `find_referencing_symbols` tools (and their JetBrains variants)
            now can return information about the symbol (docstring and signature).
        </li>
        <li><strong>Type Hierarchy Tool:</strong> A new tool that can fetch a Symbol's hierarchy. This tool is very useful
            in many situations, currently only available through the JetBrains plugin.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Better Overviews:</strong> The `get_symbols_overview` tools now return a much more compact
            representation, saving many tokens. The JetBrains variant of the tool can now return a file's docstring (LSP
            varian't can't do that yet).
        </li>
    </ul>
