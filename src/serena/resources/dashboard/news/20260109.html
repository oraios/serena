    <h3>New Type Hierarchy and Documentation Tools</h3>
    <p class="date">January 9, 2026</p>
    <p>
        We're excited to announce the introduction of powerful new tools for code navigation and understanding:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Type Hierarchy Tool:</strong> Navigate and explore type relationships in your codebase with ease. View superclasses, subclasses, and implementation hierarchies.</li>
        <li><strong>Documentation Tools:</strong> Access comprehensive documentation directly from your code, including API references, examples, and usage patterns.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        These tools enhance Serena's code intelligence capabilities, making it easier to understand complex codebases and navigate large projects efficiently.
