# This is used to start the initial language server when the project is activated.
#
# If a tool operation targets a file with a different supported language (based on its extension),
# Serena will attempt to restart the language server for that specific language.
# If the file's language is not supported or cannot be determined, this default language server will
# be used (if running).

# Whether to enable dynamic language server switching within this project.
# If true, when a tool operates on a file with a supported language extension (e.g., .py, .ts, .java)
# that differs from the currently running LSP language, Serena will attempt to restart the LSP server
# specifically for that file's language. The `default_language` server is used otherwise.
# If false, Serena will only use the LSP server configured for the `default_language`,
# and tools might fail or provide limited results for files of other languages.
